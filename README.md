# Cloud Network
This is a collection of Linux and Ansible Scripts from my Cyber Security Bootcamp

Most of the scripts are used to configure cloud servers with different docker containers.

The final setup was 2 servers running vulnerable DVWA containers along with a jump box and a server running an ELK stack container.

Below is a diagram of how the Network is configured
